**SESAM â€” Super Easy & Secure Authentication Management**

Qt-SESAM is a user-friendly application that enables you to generate strong passwords. You can use them for all the services you're using, e.g. websites, accounts, or apps.

The passwords are generated in realtime from service name, user name, a randomly shuffled salt and the master password. For services which don't allow passwords to be changed (e.g. credit cards) Qt-SESAM can also store fixed passwords.

Qt-SESAM has a unique feature which lets you choose the complexity (vertically) and length (horizontally) of the password in a colored widget:

You can share Qt-SESAM's settings across your computers via a [dedicated synchronisation server](https://github.com/ola-ct/ctSESAM-server) and a file located on a cloud drive like [OwnCloud](https://owncloud.org/), [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), [Microsoft OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/about/) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/).

This is secure because all of your settings are [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard)-encrypted with a 256 bit long [key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)) and a 128 bit long [IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector) derived from your master password with [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2).

Qt-SESAM supports Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. An [Android app](https://github.com/pinae/ctSESAM-android) compatible to Qt-SESAM is underway.
