# TODO

 - Check if MainWindow::onEscPressed() is working as expected.
 - Type name of existing domain. Domain shows up in completer. Click behind the last letter of the domain name. Completer disappears. Now you can leave the combobox.
 - Automatically migrate v2 settings to v3 settings by generating a 'xxxxxxxx...' password template (?)
