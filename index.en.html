      <p><strong>Qt-SESAM generates and manages strong passwords &mdash; safely, securely, and for free.</strong></p>
      <p>With <a href="https://github.com/ola-ct/Qt-SESAM" target="_blank">Qt-SESAM</a> you can generate and manage passwords for any service, e.g. websites, accounts, or apps.
        The passwords are generated in real-time from your master password and some service specific settings. That means that even in the almost impossible case someone managed to decrypt your encrypted settings he'd still doesn't know your master password and therefore won't be able to login to any of the services.
        For services which don't allow passwords to be changed (e.g. credit cards) Qt-SESAM can also store fixed (a.k.a. legacy) passwords.
      </p>
      <p>You can share Qt-SESAM's settings across your computers via a <a href="https://github.com/ola-ct/ctSESAM-server" target="_blank">dedicated synchronization server</a> and/or a file located on a cloud drive like OwnCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive.
        This is secure because all of your settings are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a>-encrypted with a 256&nbsp;bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)" target="_blank">key</a>.</p>
      <p>Qt-SESAM runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X. An <a href="https://github.com/pinae/ctSESAM-android" target="_blank">Android app compatible to Qt-SESAM</a> is underway.</p>

      <h2>Ready?</h2>
      <p>
        On first start Qt-SESAM asks for your master password.
        Without that secret neither passwords can be generated, nor decryption keys be calculated.
        Because the encryption methods used (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC" target="_blank">CBC</a> mode with a 256 bit key) are known to be secure, the overall security of the application and your data solely depends on the security of the master password. 
      So choose is wisely: not too hard to remember, but complex enough nobody else can guess it. And keep it in a safe place!
      A master password of at least 10 characters is re&shy;com&shy;mended.
      To make sure you've entered the master password correctly you've got to enter it twice:
      </p>
      <p>
        <video controls="controls" poster="screencasts/master-password-entry-1-en.png" preload="auto">
          <source src="screencasts/master-password-entry-1-en.webm" type="video/webm" />
          <source src="screencasts/master-password-entry-1-en.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
      </p>
      <p>
        While you type, the dialog tells you how strong the chosen master password is.
      Ratings range from <q>useless</q> over <q>you can do better</q>, <q>mediocre</q>, <q>good</q>, <q>very good</q>, and <q>fabulous</q> to <q>super&shy;cali&shy;fragi&shy;lis&shy;tic&shy;ex&shy;pia&shy;li&shy;do&shy;cious</q>.
      The OK button is activated only after you've entered the same master password again.
      </p>

      <h3>Sync first!</h3>
      <p>The first time you start Qt-SESAM on a certain computer it asks you about whether or not you like to pro&shy;vide information about your syn&shy;chro&shy;ni&shy;zation faci&shy;lities.
        If this is the first time you ever used Qt-SESAM or don't want to syn&shy;chronize your settings across computers, you can ignore the advice. 
        In any other case you're taken to the <span class="gui">Options</span> dialog where you can select a file to syn&shy;chro&shy;nize with, or the host&shy;name of syn&shy;chro&shy;ni&shy;zation server (see figures below).
        If you ignore the warning, be prepared to run into problems while using Qt-SESAM. This is because when starting Qt-SESAM for the first time on a computer, the appli&shy;cation generates the so-called key gene&shy;ration key (<a href="#kgk">KGK</a>). The KGK is used to derive your passwords later on. Given that all other settings are the same, different KGKs lead to to different passwords. Getting your settings, which include the KGK, from a syn&shy;chro&shy;ni&shy;zation file or server beforehand effec&shy;tively prevents problems with diverse KGKs.
      </p>

          <p>

          <p>Qt-SESAM will then try to read your settings from the server. On success a tiny padlock is displayed next to the <span class="gui">Check&nbsp;connectivity</span> button in <span class="gui">Options/Sync</span>.</p>

      <h2>First steps</h2>
      <p>
        Enter a new domain by typing its name into the combo box. You'll notice that the generated password changes while you type.
      That's because the <a href="#password-generation">algorithm for password generation</a> weaves the domain name into the eventually generated password.
      The same is true for the user name so you can have multiple logins with different user names and passwords for the same service.
      </p>
      <p>

    <section>
      <h2>Unique and Easy</h2>
      <p>
        Most of time the default settings for password generation will suffice (16 characters: digits, lowercase and uppercase).
      If you need more control over how the password is being generated, try out Qt-SESAM's unique feature: the easy selection widget. It lets you choose the complexity and length of the password with a single click. Red indicates bad passwords, green good ones.
      Move the marker horizontally to change password length, and vertically to change the set of characters the password is composed of.
      A set for digits as well as for lowercase and uppercase characters is predefined.
      You can define your own set by typing it into the field below the easy selection widget.
      </p>
      <p>
        <video controls="controls" poster="screencasts/enter-settings-2-en.png" preload="auto">
          <source src="screencasts/enter-settings-2-en.webm" type="video/webm" />
          <source src="screencasts/enter-settings-2-en.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
      </p>
      <p>Very neat: the widget tells you how long the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianhe-2" target="_blank">Tianhe-2 supercomputer</a> and your computer would need to crack a password with the selected settings. As you can see, increasing the password length lets the strength grow much faster than increasing the number of characters in the set. That's because the length flows in exponentially.</p>

      <h2>Internals</h2>

      <h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

      <h4 id="kgk">Key Generation Key</h4>

      <p>The crucial element of the Qt-SESAM's encryption/decryption/generation processes is the <strong>key generation key (KGK)</strong>.
        The KGK is a 512 bit value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness" target="_blank">randomly</a> chosen the first time you start Qt-SESAM on your computer. 
        It's used to derive the generated passwords and to generate a key to encrypt and decrypt the program settings.
      </p>

      <div class="figure">
        <p><img src="img/algo01-generate-kgk.png" width="426" height="69" title="KGK generation" /></p>
      </div>


      <h4 id="salt-generation">Salt</h4>

      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" target="_blank">salt</a> is also random data. It's used to protect the generated passwords and cryptographic keys against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack" target="_blank">dictionary attacks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table" target="_blank">rainbow table attacks</a>. More on that later.</p>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/algo02-generate-salt.png" width="214" height="70" title="salt generation" />
      </div>

      <h4 id="key-computation">Key computation</h4>

      <p>Any time Qt-SESAM saves the settings to a file or transfers them over the net to the synchronization server the settings are encrypted with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC" target="_blank">CBC</a> mode. Qt-SESAM uses the strongest possible AES encryption with a 256 bit key.</p>
      <p>Like any symmetric cipher AES employs a key to encrypt or decrypt data. At the beginning of an encryption or decryption process AES has to be initialized with a block of 16&nbsp;bytes. This initialization vector (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector" target="_blank">IV</a>) is computed along with the key from your master password through a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function" target="_blank">key derivation</a>. A well-tested manifestation is the Password-Based Key Derivation Function&nbsp;2 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2" target="_blank">PBKDF2</a>) which scrambles your master password with the salt just generated. It does this by repeatedly (32768 times) running the inputs through a hash-based message authentication code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code" target="_blank">HMAC</a>).</p>
      <p>The repeated hashing adds a lot of computational work to derive the key from the password. That makes it especially hard for an attacker to find the password for a known hash by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack" target="_blank">brute-force</a> methods. The HMAC used by Qt-SESAM utilizes the hashing algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank">SHA-384</a> because it pro&shy;vides a 384&nbsp;bit result needed to yield the 256&nbsp;bit AES key and 128&nbsp;bit IV.
      </p>

        <div class="title"><a class="code" href="https://github.com/ola-ct/Qt-SESAM/blob/master/libSESAM/crypter.cpp">Crypter::&shy;make&shy;Key&shy;And&shy;IV&shy;From&shy;Password()</a></div>
      </div>


      <h3 id="password-generation">Password generation</h3>

      <p>A similar method comes into effect when generating a password. First, the KGK is appended to the domain and user name to form the input to PBKDF2, spiced with a salt.</p>
      <p>The salt is shuffled the moment you create the entry for the domain or renew the generated password by pressing the button left to the password field. You can set the length of the salt via <span class="gui">Options/Misc/Salt length</span>. The default (and reasonable) length is 16&nbsp;byte. The longer the better, with 64&nbsp;bytes being the sensible upper limit.</p>
      <p>You can determine the number of iterations by selecting the value in the corresponding spinbox (first expand the <span class="gui">Advanced settings</span> section). The default value can be set via <span class="gui">Options/Misc/Default PBKDF2 ite&shy;ra&shy;tions</span>. The higher the iteration count, the better. Higher values lead to longer to compu&shy;tation times which in turn can make the user inter&shy;face somewhat doughy. The default value of 8192 is sufficient. For instance, the Wi-Fi security protocol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access#WPA2" target="_blank">WPA2</a> uses 4096 iterations.</p>
      <p>The result of the operation is a 512 bit <q>key</q>. Eventually, the password is calculated from this key (see <a href="https://github.com/ola-ct/Qt-SESAM/blob/master/libSESAM/password.cpp" class="code" target="_blank">Password::mix()</a>).</p>
      <div class="figure">

      </div>


      <h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>

      <p>That's all Qt-SESAM needs to encrypt data, i.e. KGK and domain settings.
        The encryption process looks very complicated but in fact is quite straight&shy;forward:</p>

      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          Because Qt-SESAM requires the KGK to generate your service passwords, the KGK has to be stored together with the domain settings.
          And because the KGK is needed to encrypt/decrypt the domain settings, it has to be encrypted separately.
          A second pair of salt and IV is generated for later use, and pre&shy;pended to the KGK.
          The encryption process applies the <a href="#key-computation">key and IV returned by <code>Crypter::­make­&shy;Key&shy;­And&shy;­IV&shy;­From&shy;­Password()</code></a> in the previous steps. This means that the data is effec&shy;tively encrypted with your master password.
        </li>
        <li>
          The freshly generated salt from step&nbsp;1 is used to protect the AES encryption key (1024&nbsp;times spun through PBKDF2) against dictionary and rainbow-table attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          The domain settings are formatted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a>. This is a rather verbose format for data re&shy;pre&shy;sen&shy;ta&shy;tion and is easily compressed to a fraction of its original size.
          But com&shy;pres&shy;sion does not only save space, it also adds compu&shy;ta&shy;tional effort for an adversary who has seized the encrypted data and tries to decrypt it by brute force.
        </li>
        <li>
          The key from step&nbsp;2 together with the IV shuffled for step&nbsp;1 is used to encrypt the domain settings after they've been compressed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now the encrypted data can be assembled: The first byte is a version flag (currently only <code>0x01</code> is used). Thereon follows the <a href="#salt-generation">salt</a> that was used to <a href="#key-computation">make the key and IV from the master password</a>, then the encrypted KGK from step&nbsp;1, and the result of step&nbsp;4. 
          This package can be stored anywhere without the fear of being compromised even if the hacker had long-term access to super&shy;computers. The privacy of the data contained therein totally relies on the strength of the master password &mdash; and how well you hide the password from prying eyes.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <div class="figure">
        <img src="img/algo04-encode.png" width="760" height="839" title="encoding" />

      </div>

      <h3 id="decryption">Decryption</h3>

      <p>Decrypting data works the other way round. As you can see, only the master password is needed for decryption.
        All the other inter&shy;mediately needed secrets and other bits of data are extracted piece by piece:
      </p>

      <ol class="steps">
        <li>After checking that the version number is <code>0x01</code> the encrypted package is deconstructed into its three parts.</p>
        <li>The master password together with the extracted salt gives the key and IV 
        needed to&nbsp;&hellip;</li>
        <li>&hellip;&nbsp;decrypt the encrypted KGK, salt, and IV.</li>
        <li>Now that the salt is available it can be used to calculate the decryption key.</li>
        <li>The encrypted data can then be decrypted with that key and the IV from step&nbsp;3. After deflation the data is ready for use.</li>
      </ol>
