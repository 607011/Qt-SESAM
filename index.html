    <p class="subheading"><span class="capitals">SESAM</span> &mdash; Super Easy & Secure Authentication Management</p>
    <p>Qt-SESAM is a user-friendly application that enables you to generate and manage strong passwords &mdash; safely and securely.</p>
    <p>You can use the passwords for any services, e.g. websites, accounts, or apps.
      The passwords are generated in realtime from your master password and some service specific settings.
      You can generate more than one password for a service.
      For services which don't allow passwords to be changed (e.g. credit cards) Qt-SESAM can also store fixed passwords.</p>

    <p>On first start Qt-SESAM wants to know your master password. 
      All the generated passwords and the keys to encrypt your settings are derived from that secret.
      Thus the overall security of the application and your data solely depends on the security of the master password.
      So choose is wisely: not too hard to remember, but complex enough nobody else can guess it.
      A master password of at least 10 characters is recommended.
      To make sure you've entered the master password correctly you've got to enter it twice:</p>

        <source src="screencasts/master-password-entry-1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      </video>
    </p>
    <p>As you type the dialog tells you how strong the chosen master password is.
      Ratings range from "useless" over "you can do better", "mediocre" and "very good" to "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious".
      The OK button is activated after you've entered the same master password again.

    <p>Later on you've got to type your master password only once.</p>

    <p>Qt-SESAM comes with a unique feature: the easy selection widget. It lets you choose the complexity and length of the password with a single click.</p>
    <p>The widget tells you how long the Tianhe-2 supercomputer and your computer would need to crack a password with the selected settings.</p>
