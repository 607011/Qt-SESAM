    <p class="subheading"><span class="capitals">SESAM</span> &mdash; Super Easy & Secure Authentication Management</p>
    <p>Qt-SESAM is a user-friendly application that enables you to generate strong passwords. 
      You can use them for all the services you're using, e.g. web sites, accounts, or apps.
      The passwords are generated in realtime from service name, user name, a randomly shuffled salt and the master password.
      For services which don't allow passwords to be changed (e.g. credit cards) Qt-SESAM can also store fixed passwords.</p>

    <p>On first start Qt-SESAM wants to know your master password. 
      All the generated passwords and the keys to encrypt your settings are derived from that secret.
      Thus the overall security of the application and your data solely depends on the security of the master password.
      So choose is wisely: not too hard to remember, but complex enough nobody else can guess it.
      A master password of at least 10 characters is recommended.
      To make sure you've entered the master password correctly you've got to enter it twice.</p>

    <p>Qt-SESAM comes with a unique feature: the easy selection widget. It lets you choose the complexity and length of the password with a single click.</p>
    <p>The widget tells you how long the Tianhe-2 supercomputer and your computer would need to crack a password with the selected settings.</p>
