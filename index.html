      <h1>Qt-SESAM</h1>
      <p class="subheading"><span class="capitals">SESAM</span> &mdash; Super Easy &amp; Secure Authentication Management</p>
      <p><strong>Qt-SESAM generates and manages strong passwords &mdash; safely, securely, and for free.</strong></p>
      <p>
        <a class="download" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ola-ct/Qt-SESAM/releases">Download binaries</a>
        <a class="download" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ola-ct/Qt-SESAM">Get source code</a>
      </p>
      <p>You can use the passwords for any service, e.g. websites, accounts, or apps.
        The passwords are generated in real-time from your master password and some service specific settings.
        You can generate more than one password for a service.
        For services which don't allow passwords to be changed (e.g. credit cards) Qt-SESAM can also store fixed passwords.
      </p>
      <p>You can share Qt-SESAM's settings across your computers via a <a href="https://github.com/ola-ct/ctSESAM-server" target="_blank">dedicated synchronization server</a> and/or a file located on a cloud drive like OwnCloud, Dropbox, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive.
        This is secure because all of your settings are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a>-encrypted with a 256&nbsp;bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_(cryptography)" target="_blank">key</a>.</p>
      <p>Qt-SESAM runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X. An <a href="https://github.com/pinae/ctSESAM-android" target="_blank">Android app compatible to Qt-SESAM</a> is underway.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Ready?</h2>
      <p>On first start Qt-SESAM wants to know your master password.
        All the generated passwords and the keys to encrypt your settings are derived from that secret. 
        Because the encryption methods used (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC" target="_blank">CBC</a> mode with a 256 bit key) are known to be secure, the overall security of the application and your data solely depends on the security of the master password. 
      So choose is wisely: not too hard to remember, but complex enough nobody else can guess it. And keep it in a safe place!
      A master password of at least 10 characters is recommended.
      To make sure you've entered the master password correctly you've got to enter it twice:
      </p>
      <p>
        <video controls="controls" poster="img/master-password-entry-1.png">
          <source src="screencasts/master-password-entry-1.webm" type="video/webm" />
          <source src="screencasts/master-password-entry-1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
      </p>
      <p>
        While you type, the dialog tells you how strong the chosen master password is.
      Ratings range from <span class="quote">useless</span> over <span class="quote">you can do better</span>, <span class="quote">mediocre</span>, <span class="quote">good</span>, <span class="quote">very good</span>, and <span class="quote">fabulous</span> to <span class="quote">supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</span>.
      The OK button is activated only after you've entered the same master password again.
      </p>

      <h3>Sync first!</h3>
      <p>The first time you start Qt-SESAM on a certain computer it asks you about whether or not you like to provide information about your synchronization facilities.
        If this is the first time you ever used Qt-SESAM or don't want to synchronize your settings across computers, you can ignore the advice. 
        In any other case you're taken to the <span class="gui">Options</span> dialog where you can select a file to synchronize with, or the hostname of synchronization server.
        If you ignore the warning, be prepared to run into problems while using Qt-SESAM. This is because when starting Qt-SESAM for the first time on a computer the application generates the so-called key generation key (<a href="#kgk">KGK</a>) from which your passwords are derived later on. Given that all other settings are the same, different KGKs lead to to different passwords. Getting your settings, which include the KGK, from a synchronization file or server beforehand effectively prevents problems with diverse KGKs.
      </p>

      <h2>First steps</h2>
      <p>
        Enter a new domain by typing its name into the combo box. You'll notice that the generated password changes while you type.
      That's because the <a href="#password-generation">algorithm for password generation</a> weaves the domain name into the eventually generated password.
      The same is true for the user name so you can have multiple logins with different user names and passwords for the same service.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Unique and Easy</h2>
      <p>
        Most of time the default settings for password generation will suffice (16 characters: digits, lowercase and uppercase).
      If you need more control over how the password is being generated, try out Qt-SESAM's unique feature: the easy selection widget. It lets you choose the complexity and length of the password with a single click.
      Move the marker horizontally to change password length, and vertically to change the set of characters the password is composed of.
      A set for digits as well as lowercase and uppercase characters is predefined.
      You can choose an own set by typing it into the field below the easy selection widget.
      </p>
      <p>
        <video controls="controls" poster="img/enter-settings-2.png">
          <source src="screencasts/enter-settings-2.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          <source src="screencasts/enter-settings-2.webm" type="video/webm" />
        </video>
      </p>
      <p>Very neat: the widget tells you how long the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianhe-2" target="_blank">Tianhe-2 supercomputer</a> and your computer would need to crack a password with the selected settings.</p>

      <h2>Internals</h2>

      <h3 id="basics">Basics</h3>

      <h4 id="kgk">Key Generation Key</h4>

      <p>The crucial element of the Qt-SESAM's encryption/decryption/generation processes is the <strong>key generation key (KGK)</strong>.
        The KGK is a 512 bit value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness" target="_blank">randomly</a> chosen the first time you start Qt-SESAM on your computer. 
        It's used to derive the generated passwords and to generate a key to encrypt and decrypt the program settings.
      </p>

      <p class="figure">
        <img src="img/algo01-generate-kgk.png" width="426" height="69" title="KGK generation" />
      </p>


      <h4 id="salt-generation">Salt</h4>

      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)" target="_blank">salt</a> is also random data. It's used to protect the generated passwords and cryptographic keys against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack" target="_blank">dictionary attacks</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table" target="_blank">rainbow table attacks</a>. More on that later.</p>

      <p class="figure">
        <img src="img/algo02-generate-salt.png" width="214" height="70" title="salt generation" />
      </p>

      <h4 id="key-computation">Key computation</h4>

      <p>Any time Qt-SESAM saves the settings to a file or transfers them over the net to the synchronization server the settings are encrypted with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" target="_blank">AES</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#CBC" target="_blank">CBC</a> mode. Qt-SESAM uses the strongest possible AES encryption with a 256 bit key.</p>
      <p>Like any symmetric cipher AES employs a key to encrypt or decrypt data. At the beginning of an encryption or decryption process AES has to be initialized with a block of 16&nbsp;bytes. This initialization vector (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector" target="_blank">IV</a>) is computed along with the key from your master password through a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function" target="_blank">key derivation</a>. A well-tested manifestation is the Password-Based Key Derivation Function&nbsp;2 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2" target="_blank">PBKDF2</a>) which scrambles an input (your master password) with the salt just generated. It does this by repeatedly (32768 times) running the inputs through a hash-based message authentication code (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash-based_message_authentication_code" target="_blank">HMAC</a>).</p>
      <p>The repeated hashing adds a lot of computational work to derive the key from the password. That makes it especially hard for an attacker to find the password for a known hash by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack" target="_blank">brute-force</a> methods. The HMAC used by Qt-SESAM utilizes the hashing algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" target="_blank">SHA-384</a> because it provides a 384&nbsp;bit result needed to yield the 256&nbsp;bit AES key and 128&nbsp;bit IV.
      </p>

      <p class="figure">
        <img src="img/algo03a-make-key-iv.png" width="477" height="142" title="Crypter::makeKeyIVFromPassword()" />

      </p>


      <h3 id="password-generation">Password generation</h3>

      <p>A similar method comes into effect when generating a password. First, the KGK is appended to the domain and user name to form the input to PBKDF2 together with a salt.</p>
      <p>The salt is shuffled the moment you create the entry for the domain or renew the generated password by pressing the button left to the password field. You can set the length of the salt via <span class="gui">Options/Misc/Salt length</span>. The default (and reasonable) length is 16 bytes. The longer the better, with 64 bytes being the sensible upper limit.</p>
      <p>You can determine the number of iterations by selecting the value in the corresponding spinbox (first expand the <span class="gui">Advanced settings</span> section). </p>
      <p>The result of the operation is a 512 bit long <span class="quote">key</span>.</p>
      <p class="figure">
        <img src="img/algo03b-make-key.png" width="646" height="154" title="Password::generate()" />
        <span class="title"><a class="code" href="https://github.com/ola-ct/Qt-SESAM/blob/master/libSESAM/password.cpp">Password::&shy;generate()</a></span>
      </p>
      <p>Eventually, the password is calculated from this key (see <a href="https://github.com/ola-ct/Qt-SESAM/blob/master/libSESAM/password.cpp" class="code" target="_blank">Password::mix()</a>).</p>


      <h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>

      <p>That's all Qt-SESAM needs to encrypt data (KGK, domain settings).
        The encryption process looks very complicated but in fact is quite straightforward.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="step">1</span>
        Because Qt-SESAM needs the KGK to generate your service passwords, the KGK has to be stored together with the domain settings.
        And because the KGK is needed to encrypt/decrypt the domain settings, it has to be encrypted separately.
        A second pair of salt and IV is generated for later use, and prepended to the KGK.
        The encryption process applies the <a href="#key-computation">key and IV returned by <code>Crypter::­make­Key­And­IV­From­Password()</code></a> in the previous steps. This means that the data is effectively encrypted with your master password.
        </p>
      <p>
        <span class="step">2</span>
        The freshly generated salt from step&nbsp;1 is used to protect the AES encryption key (1024&nbsp; times spun through PBKDF2) against dictionary and rainbow-table attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="step">3</span>
        The domain settings are formatted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a>. This is a rather verbose format for data representation and is easily compressed to a fraction of the original size.
        But compression not only saves space, it also adds computational effort for an adversary who has seized the encrypted data and tries to decrypt it with brute-force methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="step">4</span>
        This key together with the IV from step&nbsp;1 is used to encrypt the domain settings after they have been compressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="step">5</span>
        Now the encrypted data can be assembled: The first byte is a version flag (currently only <code>0x01</code> is used). Thereon follows the <a href="#salt-generation">salt</a> that was used to <a href="#key-computation">make the key and IV from the master password</a>, then the encrypted KGK from step&nbsp;1, and the result from step&nbsp;4. 
        This package can be stored anywhere without the fear of being compromised even if the hacker had long-term access to supercomputers. The privacy of the data contained therein totally relies on the strength of the master password, and how well you keep the password away from unauthorized people.

      </p>


      <h3 id="decryption">Decryption</h3>

      <p>Decrypting data works the other way round. As you can see, only the master password is needed for decryption.
        All the other intermediately needed secrets and other bits of data are extracted piece by piece.
      </p>
